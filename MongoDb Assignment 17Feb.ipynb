    "#Ques1: What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "'''MongoDB is a popular non-relational document-oriented database that stores data in flexible and semi-structured BSON (Binary JSON) format. MongoDB is designed \n",
    "to handle large volumes of unstructured data and is often used in web and mobile applications to store data such as user profiles, session data, product catalogs,\n",
    "and social network feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational database model based on tables and SQL queries. \n",
    "Instead, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models such as document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph-based to store and retrieve data. NoSQL \n",
    "databases are often preferred over traditional SQL databases for their ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data and their flexibility to scale \n",
    "horizontally across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility is key - Since MongoDB stores data in a flexible document-based format, it's easier to modify the data schema without changing the entire database \n",
    "structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling is important - MongoDB has built-in support for horizontal scaling, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high-traffic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time data processing - MongoDB is designed to handle real-time data processing and analytics, making it a popular choice for applications that require \n",
    "fast and efficient data retrieval and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapid application development - MongoDB's flexible schema and document-based storage make it easier and faster to develop and iterate on applications."

    "#Ques2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "'''MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database that is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Some of the key features of \n",
    "MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-based data model: MongoDB stores data in flexible and semi-structured BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which can contain nested fields and arrays. This \n",
    "allows for more natural representation of data than traditional SQL databases, which use a rigid table-based data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by sharding data across multiple servers, making it easier to handle large volumes of data and \n",
    "high-traffic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB provides automatic failover and data redundancy, making it a highly available database that can survive hardware or network failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and aggregation: MongoDB provides support for secondary indexes and a powerful aggregation framework, making it easy to perform complex queries and data\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad hoc queries: MongoDB allows for ad hoc queries, which means that queries can be made without having to first define a schema or structure for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that includes support for regular expressions, range queries, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB has a flexible schema that allows developers to modify the data model without having to change the entire database structure, making it\n",
    "easier to iterate on application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-document transactions: MongoDB now supports multi-document transactions, allowing developers to perform atomic operations across multiple documents."
