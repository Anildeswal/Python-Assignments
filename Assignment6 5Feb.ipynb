    "For example, a class \"Car\" can have properties such as make, model, color, and horsepower and methods such as start, stop,\n",
    "and drive.\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class and represents a specific instance of the class.\n",
    "Objects are created from classes and are sometimes referred to as instances.\n",

    "#ques2: Name the four pillars of OOPs?\n",
    "'''The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the ability of an object to hide its internal complexity and only reveal the essential features required to interact with it. This helps in reducing the complexity of the code and making it more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the practice of wrapping data and methods within an object to protect them from outside access or modification. It creates a boundary around the data, preventing unauthorized access and making it safer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class. This allows for creating new classes that are based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class. This allows for greater flexibility in the code and a more generic approach to problem-solving.'''"

The newly derived class is called a subclass, and the class it inherits from is called a superclass.\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance: a subclass inherits from a single superclass. For example, a \"Bird\" class that inherits characteristics from an \"Animal\" class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Multi-level inheritance: a subclass inherits from a superclass, and then the subclass acts as a superclass for another subclass. For example, a \"Pelican\" class inherits from a \"Bird\" class, and then a \"AustralianPelican\" class inherits from the \"Pelican\" class.\n",
