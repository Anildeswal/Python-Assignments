    "\n",
    "1. Increased Efficiency: APIs allow developers to reuse code and services already built by others, which saves time and resources.\n",

    "2. Improved Functionality: APIs provide access to features and data that may not be available within an application or platform, enabling developers to create more\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Simplified Integration: APIs provide a standard interface that simplifies integration with other systems, platforms, and services.\n",

    "Disadvantages of using API:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Security Risks: API access can introduce security vulnerabilities if not designed and implemented correctly. Attackers can use APIs to exploit data, services,\n",
    "   and functionality provided by the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of Control: APIs may lack the flexibility and control that developers require. APIs can change or be deprecated, which may impact the application's \n",
    "   functionality or break it entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dependency on Third-Party Services: APIs rely on third-party services, which can be a disadvantage if these services experience downtime, performance issues, or \n",
    "   pricing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Technical Complexity: APIs can be complex to use and require technical expertise. Developers need to understand the API documentation, code, and functionality to\n",
    "   use the API effectively.\n",
